        <p>
        I am a problem-solver at heart, dedicated to transforming complex challenges into simple, intuitive, and user-friendly experiences. With expertise in modern programming languages and frameworks, I specialize in building dynamic front-end interfaces using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Vue.js, while also developing reliable back-end systems with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and FaunaDB. My goal is to create efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions that deliver exceptional value.
