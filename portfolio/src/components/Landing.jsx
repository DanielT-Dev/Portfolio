            Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with a passion for building end-to-end digital solutions that are both functional and visually engaging. Proficient in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue.js) and back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Express, and Django, I bring a holistic approach to web development. From designing intuitive user interfaces to developing scalable server-side architectures and managing databases (SQL, MongoDB), I ensure seamless performance and a great user experience across the stack. Whether itâ€™s crafting dynamic web applications, optimizing APIs, or deploying cloud-based solutions, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. Letâ€™s create something impactful together!
