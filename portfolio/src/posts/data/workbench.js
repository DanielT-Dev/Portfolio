            paragraph: `Dynamic memory allocation in C and C++ is a feature that allows the programmer to allocate memory at runtime, as needed, rather than at compile time. This means that the amount of memory allocated during program execution can vary depending on the program's requirements. `,

        {
            header: "Static vs. Dynamic memory allocation?",
            paragraph: `The main difference between static and dynamic memory allocation is that static memory is allocated at compile time and its size is fixed, while dynamic memory is allocated during program execution and its size can change during the runtime. Additionally, dynamic memory requires the use of special functions like malloc() and free() for memory allocation and deallocation, whereas static memory is automatically handled by the compiler.`,
